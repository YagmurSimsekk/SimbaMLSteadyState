Machine Learning
================

Besides allowing the generation of data, **SimbaML** provides functionalities to easily integrated the generated data into the machine learning process.

Time-Series-Prediction
----------------------

**SimbaML**'s main strength lies in leveraging prior knowledge of ODEs to run time-series predictions.
That is, we predict a certain number of time-steps into the future based on a defined number of input time-steps.
