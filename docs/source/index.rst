**SimbaML** is an all-in-one framework for integrating prior knowledge of ODE models into the ML process by synthetic data augmentation.
It allows for the convenient generation of realistic synthetic data by sparsifying and adding noise.
Furthermore, our framework provides customizable pipelines for various ML experiments, such as identifying needs for data collection and transfer learning.
